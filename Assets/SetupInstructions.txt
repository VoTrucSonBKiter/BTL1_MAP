BTL1_MAP - Unity Conversion Setup Instructions

To complete the setup of the Unity version of the BTL1_MAP application, please follow these steps:

1. Create four Unity scenes in the Assets/Scenes directory:
   - SignScene.unity (login screen)
   - MainScene.unity (main menu)
   - CameraScene.unity (camera functionality)
   - PositionScene.unity (sensor data display)

2. For each scene, create appropriate UI elements:

   SignScene:
   - Create a Canvas with:
     - Email input field (TMP_InputField)
     - PID input field (TMP_InputField)
     - Login button
     - Status text (TextMeshProUGUI)
   - Add the SignManager script to a GameObject in the scene

   MainScene:
   - Create a Canvas with:
     - Welcome text (TextMeshProUGUI)
     - Camera button
     - Position button
     - Logout button
   - Add the MainManager script to a GameObject in the scene

   CameraScene:
   - Create a Canvas with:
     - RawImage for camera preview
     - Capture button
     - Back button
   - Add the CameraManager script to a GameObject in the scene

   PositionScene:
   - Create a Canvas with:
     - Accelerometer text (TextMeshProUGUI)
     - Gyroscope text (TextMeshProUGUI)
     - Back button
   - Add the PositionManager script to a GameObject in the scene

3. Create a permanent GameObject:
   - Create an empty GameObject named "SceneManager"
   - Add the SceneLoader script to it
   - In the first scene, check "Don't Destroy On Load" for this GameObject

4. Set up Build Settings:
   - Open Build Settings (File > Build Settings)
   - Add all four scenes to the build
   - Set SignScene as the first scene in the build order
   - Configure Player Settings for your target platform

5. To connect to the backend:
   - Ensure the backend server is running
   - Check that the apiUrl in SignManager.cs is correct
   - For mobile builds, update network security settings

The C# scripts have been created with all the necessary functionality. You only need to create the UI elements and connect them to the scripts via the Unity Inspector.
